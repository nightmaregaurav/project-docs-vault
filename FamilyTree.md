## Abstract â€“ Family Tree: A Computerized System for Visualizing and Managing Ancestral Lineage

With 'Family Tree', I intend to allow users to create, collect, organize, visualize and print their family tree using their phone or computer. This system will help researchers or individuals who are interested in identifying their family tree and their ancestors, know exact relationship amongst family members and eliminate the tedious task of searching their name in the family tree book that were previously used to be hand written. This System will help its users to find, identify, and know details about their relatives. This system also has a potential of becoming go-to system for family chat and connection. So, from this project, I intend to build a computerized family tree system.
